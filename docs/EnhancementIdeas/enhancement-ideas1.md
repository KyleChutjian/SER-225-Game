#Current Enhancement Ideas

##Enhancement #1 - Storyline 
In the original version of the game, there was only 1 level with 1 NPC, the Walrus. 
We thought it was funny to include him into every level and have him betray the cat at the end.
We envisioned a boss battle on the final level when exiting the Volcano, but we didn't plan enough to implement it.
For this enhancement you can improve the storyline, maybe animating the story screen levels or making it more in-depth.

##Enhancement #2 - Improving Item Block
While making the Item Block, we had very little to work with when it came to choosing items to put inside of it.
Currently, the options are +1 heart, +1 coin, and an enemy. 

##Enhancement #3 - Attack Feature
We kept thinking of adding this, but never got around to it. 
Some other groups in our class did this already by making the cat shoot a fireball like the Dinosaur does. 
We think you should come up with a more creative way though.
A different idea is jumping on top of some enemies will kill them like it does in Mario.
Maybe both?

##Enhancement #4 - More Enhanced Map Tiles
Currently, we have added the Item Block, Curiosity Orb, and coins as our enhanced map tiles to make the levels more interesting.
Enhanced map tiles can vary. Maybe the cat can get a pet which can attack enemies, or an invisibility power-up.
We were hoping you can be a little more creative than us when it came to this.

##Enhancement #5 - Two-way Branches
A simple idea, but if you press the duck key while standing on top of a branch you will fall through it. 
Currently, you can jump up from underneath, but not duck to go down.
