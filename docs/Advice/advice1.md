#Advice

On this page, you can find some advice from your prior SER-225 developers


##Tip #1
First of all, please help yourself and read these documents on GitHub instead of your IDE.

##Tip #2
We advise that you genuinely read `ALL` documents in this project folder. 
When we first read these files from Professor Thimineur (Alex), he gave us a good understanding of what he was planning and how the program generally works.

##Tip #3
All of you will be communicating a lot more than you think during this semester, so it's best that you start breaking the ice early.
For example: our group communicated primarily through Discord where we would occasionally play Among Us, hold an extra meeting to talk and help each other with our work units, or
just send each other funny memes in our discord chat.

##Tip #4
Once you start the programming process, choose your Scrum Master and Git Master sooner than later.
In our group, we had many Git troubles during our first Scrum Sprint. We highly recommend that your Git Master should watch Alex's 50 minute video explaining Git.

##Tip #5
Since we are the last SER-225 class Professor Hoffman will teach, we do not know who your future Professor will be or how the class will function. On the occasion that it is not Alex,
you should consider messaging him on Discord for any assistance: `alex_thimineur#9806`

##Tip #6
As a final note, when you reach the end of your Scrum Sprint 4, help your next set of developers out by writing these files in the same format.
For example, your advice document will be in this Advice package and be named `advice2.md` since you were the second group to enhance the project.


     Good Luck!
