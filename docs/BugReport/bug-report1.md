# Updated Bug Report

## Bug #1 - Key Overrides
We continuously forgot this was a bug, and has been there since the very start.
For more information, check the last bug in: bug-report.md

## Bug #2 - Item Block Audio when Pausing
After hitting the Item Block and spamming the pause button, the audio gets delayed and sometimes happens again when restarting the level.

## Bug #3 - Volume Mixer
The volume mixer itself works fine, but change what values each percent has.
25%, 50%, and 75% volume should be updated. 
Also, when changing the sound effect settings, it updates late. 
For example: when switching from 25% to 50%, it will play the 25% audio. 
We fixed this for the music part, but forgot to fix for the sound effects.
